# TubeSpam dataset

The TubeSpam dataset  (Alberto et al 2015) (training *N = 1407*; validation *N = 157*; testing *N = 392*) is applied to 10 labeling functions defined for this dataset in the Snorkel documentation [(https://github.com/snorkel-team/snorkel-tutorials)](https://github.com/snorkel-team/snorkel-tutorials). Note that these datasets are derived from the original TubeSpam dataset (total *N = 1961*) rather than the truncated version used by Snorkel (total *N = 1836*).
